## Encouraging moderation

A Brief Background:
We are interested in modeling how ideological views held by societies at large evolve over time. 
In the Marvel Hong Papush Strogatz model, the probability of a personâ€™s switching their ideological 
stance is dependent upon both their own level of extremism and the people with whom they come into contact. 
The current model relates the way populations on two sides of an issue evolve over time to their initial values, 
and incorporates parameters relating to stubborness of moderates, the capacity of moderates to persuade extremists, 
and outside media influence.

Running the code:

### simulation1.py 
a basic agent based simulation where each person agent has a probablitiy of changing. This is not based on
interactions and has arbitraily chosen probablities.

in the command line run:

```
python simulation1.py
```

### simple_interactions.py
an agent based model that tries to tackle individuals interacting with only a fixed number of people near them, 
which is preassigned. 

in the command line run:

```
python simulation1.py
```
